=head1 NAME

Module::Pluggable::Dependency - order plugins based on inter-plugin dependencies

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Module::Pluggable::Dependency version 0.0.3


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClass;
    use Module::Pluggable::Dependency;

and then later ...

    use MyClass;
    my $mc = MyClass->new();
    # returns the names of all plugins installed under MyClass::Plugin::*
    # sorted so that plugins are listed after all their dependencies
    my @plugins = $mc->plugins();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Module::Pluggable::Dependency> provides a way to run plugins in situations
where one plugin depends on running after other plugins run.  This module is
similar to L<Module::Pluggable::Ordered> but it determines ordering via
dependencies instead of precedence levels.

Each plugin may implement an optional C<depends> method which returns a list
of the plugins upon which it depends.  L<Module::Pluggable::Dependency> makes
sure that plugins are returned in an order which meets the dependency
hierarchy.

Why would you use this?  Let's say you have a series of plugins for caching
complex calculations.  Some of the plugins base their complex calculations on
the calculations of other plugins.  You need to be sure that each plugin is
only run after it's dependencies have been run.  Because the ordering of
plugins is specified through dependencies, additional plugins may be added
without manually determining the needed precedence levels.

=head1 INTERFACE

L<Module::Pluggable::Dependency> should be a drop-in replacement for
L<Module::Pluggable>.  It accepts all the same options and just modifies the
behavior of the C<plugins> sub (or whatever you named it via C<sub_name>).

=head2 depends

Any plugin wanting to indicate it's dependence on another plugin should
implement a C<depends> method.  The method should return a list of class names
for the plugins upon which it depends.  For example:

    package My::Plugin::Foo;
    sub stuff { ... }
    
    package My::Plugin::Bar;
    sub stuff { ... }
    sub depends { qw( My::Plugin::Foo ) }

Because C<My::Plugin::Foo> doesn't have a C<depends> method, it's assumed that
the plugin has no dependencies.  C<My::Plugin::Bar> however, must be run after
the "Foo" plugin.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Exceptions from L<Algorithm::Dependency::Ordered> are propagated.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Module::Pluggable::Dependency requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None known.  You should even be able to use L<Module::Pluggable::Dependency>
at the same time as L<Module::Pluggable> and other derived classes.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item *

Missing plugin dependencies aren't handled

=item *

Error reporting for circular plugin dependencies should be handled with a
module-specific error message.
